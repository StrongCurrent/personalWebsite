      <article>
        Welcome visitors 🖖, i am based in Hamburg and so keen to get into web development. Looking forward to learn a lot. I'm a trained media designer for digital and
        printmedia but the last years i've been working in office organization
        and management. I used some of html and css during my career but looking
        forward to learn much more and get in touch with more technologies.

        social openness and communication skills

        <strong>Personal Motivation</strong><br>
        Colleagues, superiors, customers, fun and the challenge are things that
        motivate me among others. I want to use, deepen and expand my knowledge
        and skills, be independent and make a meaningful contribution to our
        society through my performance.
